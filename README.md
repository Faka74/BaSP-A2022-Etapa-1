Week one:We worked as a team designing in figma the prototype of the web page that we were going to create later.

Week two:We made the first forms, texts, titles, images and others with html, the group began to help each other and that was very good for group and personal progress.

Week three:Introducing in week 3 we begin to see colors, introduction of fonts and everything necessary to style our html, the group is getting better and better when we start talking about life.

Week four:In week four is where everything starts to get nice since we begin to see flexbox, one of the most useful technologies in my opinion, the group is still just as united.

Week five:The expectations with respect to last week grew a lot since I am liking this new world called Javascript, with respect to the group they were 5 very positive weeks with very good people who have to say goodbye because we will have new groups.

Pd:The expectations to continue with this course are very high, the group that was formed always goes forward and they seem to be good people.
