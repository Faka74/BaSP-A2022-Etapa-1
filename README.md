Week one:We worked as a team designing in figma the prototype of the web page that we were going to create later.

Week two:We made the first forms, texts, titles, images and others with html, the group began to help each other and that was very good for group and personal progress.

Week three:Introducing in week 3 we begin to see colors, introduction of fonts and everything necessary to style our html, the group is getting better and better when we start talking about life

Week four:In week four is where everything starts to get nice since we begin to see flexbox, one of the most useful technologies in my opinion, the group is still just as united.

Pd:The expectations to continue with this course are very high, the group that was formed always goes forward and they seem to be good people

Pd:In this problem I had problems with min width since I had never used it before, but using max width I got better and more correct results.
